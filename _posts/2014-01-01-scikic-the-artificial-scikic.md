title: 'Scikic: The Artificial Psychic'
abstract: |-
  In this project you will contribute to an artificial psychic called scikic. The artificial psychic will work by querying a user on preferences about life (e.g. movies) and making predictions about what type of person the user is. Scikic could either be a web interface or a mobile phone app, but the main initial task will be to build scikic’s information engine. Initially scikic won’t be a very good artificial psychic (its information engine will be a little rusty), but over time scikic should be able to make good predictions about people using only a little information. Software for the project will be written according to the principles of open data science.
  
  This project will suit students with strong analytical skills, there will be a focus on linear algebra and probabilistic inference in the software.
