title: Gesture Recognition using Kinect and Python
abstract: |-
  Kinect cameras provide true image and an associated depth image. In this project the focus will be on data from the Gesture Recognition Challenge for kinect: <http://www.kaggle.com/c/GestureChallenge/>. The student will participate in the challenge using state of the art machine learning techniques with the assistance of the Sheffield Machine Learning group. A gesture recognizer for the Kinect would enable a large range of new interfaces between the human and computer. Software for the project will be written according to the principles of open data science.\
  \
  This project will suit students with strong analytical skills, there will be a focus on linear algebra and probabilistic inference in the software.
