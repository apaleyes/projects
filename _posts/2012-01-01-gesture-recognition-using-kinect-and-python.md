title: Gesture Recognition using Kinect and Python
layout: bscproject
categories:
- MSc

running: True
year: 2012
abstract: |-
  Kinect cameras provide true image and an associated depth image. In this project the focus will be on data from the Gesture Recognition Challenge for kinect: <http://www.kaggle.com/c/GestureChallenge/>. The student will participate in the challenge using state of the art machine learning techniques with the assistance of the Sheffield Machine Learning group. A gesture recognizer for the Kinect would enable a large range of new interfaces between the human and computer. Software for the project will be written according to the principles of open data science.
  
  This project will suit students with strong analytical skills, there will be a focus on linear algebra and probabilistic inference in the software.
