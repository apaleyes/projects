title: "A user-centric meta-library for Gaussian processes"
abstract: |-
  Gaussian processes are a powerful tool to quickly formulate interpretable machine learning models and make sense of data.
  A number of implementations of Gaussian processes are available in the Python ecosystem for data-science.
  They are based on several linear algebra backends for machine learning, such as [GPy (numpy)](https://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/), [GPflow (tensorflow)](https://www.gpflow.org/), and [GPyTorch (pytorch)](https://gpytorch.ai/).
  Existing GP libraries have a strong focus on research, enabling experts to formulate new types of models and inference schemes.
  The aim of this project is to provide a common and light interface to these libraries that makes it easy for domain-experts to build GPs that work in practice.

## FAQs

- What will I learn in this Project?

  You will learn about Gaussian processes and associated ML modelling choices, interact with multiple deep learning frameworks and develop and publish a Python library.

- What is the objective of the project?

  You will provide a Python library that will enable researchers that are not ML experts to use Gaussian processes in their projects.
  After surveying the landscape of GP libraries, you will design and implement a meta-library for machine learning with Gaussian processes.
  We aim to provide software and documentation that is easy to use, understand and communicate.

- How does this fit in the bigger picture?

  This project is part of the [Accelerate Science initiative](https://acceleratescience.github.io/) that aims to advance scientific discovery with machine learning.
  Easy-to-use libraries enable researches to apply ML to their projects quickly and confidently.
  You will have a chance to interact with the wider team both in the machine learning and broader scientific communities.
