title: "Decision Support for Cities Management"
abstract: |-
  Smart cities are urban environments where computing devices generate considerable amounts of heterogeneous data. Cities' authorities need sophisticated platforms to manage and analyse such data before using it. In this project you will provide a flexible, scalable, and real time decision-support tool for city managers. This tool will manage data from heterogeneous sources and provide meaningful insights to city managers to support their decisions.

## FAQs

* What will I learn in this Project?

  You will learn about software design decisions behind the implementation of a scalable and flexible system that handles large, heterogeneous, and real time data in a city wide environment.
  
  You will learn about the infrastructure behind data science and machine learning and how to build such infrastructure in a cloud environment.
    
* What is the objective of the project?

  You will provide a decision-support tool for city managers. This tool will include flexible data collection mechanisms (e.g., REST API clients) to get cities' data from heterogenous sources, data management and infrastructure components that store/stream cities' data according to its nature (e.g., real time vs non-real time data), data analysis components that discover correlations between the cities' data and provide meaningful insights for managers, and a visualisation tool that shows such insights.
    
* How does this fit in the bigger picture?

  This project is part of a wider project called AutoAI. The aim is to build explainable and maintainable machine learning systems. You will have a chance to interact with the wider team and a successful project will form part of the portfolio of AutoAI demonstrations.
